# Shopping Application

## About the Project
This project is a simple shopping application written in Java.  
I created it as part of a university assignment to practice basic programming and object-oriented concepts.

The program simulates a small shopping system where users can view products, add items to a cart, and manage their purchases through a console menu.

## What the Program Can Do
- Display available products
- Add items to a shopping cart
- Remove items from the cart
- View cart contents
- Calculate total price
- Handle basic user input

## Why I Built This
The goal of this project was to improve my understanding of:
- classes and objects
- program flow and logic
- data handling
- user interaction
